## Getting Started
### Frontend
The `frontend` directory contains the React Native project files. This is where the user interface of the application is developed.

Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v21.6.1)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (~49.0.15)

### Backend
The `backend` directory contains the ASP.NET web service code. It consists of controllers, models, services, and configuration files necessary for the backend functionality.

Prerequisites:
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) (v8.0.100)

### Scripts
The `scripts` directory contains Python scripts that serve additional functionalities for the project.

Prerequisites:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.11.7)
- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/#installation-and-usage) (v4.9.0.80)
- [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/master) (v1.2.2)

## Installation
1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the Expo development server.
```
expo start
```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
   - Build and run the project to start the ASP.NET web service.

3. **Scripts Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `scripts` directory.
   - Install any necessary Python dependencies.
   - Execute the scripts as needed.

## Usage
